## we examine heart attack prediction factors including: 


## Data Collecting (ETL)

## PCA
* Since we are looking at many different factors to predict an outcome, it will be helpful to reduce the dimensions to provide simplicity. This will reduce accuracy but will make it easier to see the approximation of every variable.
* We hope to reduce our data to only two dimensions 
* There is a lot of variance within each of our variables, we want to simplify and create bigger, more meaningful features
* Using PCA we find three clusters, which we can then use to categorize individuals based on certain traits
* We find there are three clusters, which here means groups that have certain characteristics

* Gives an overall more simplistic view of our data
