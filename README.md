## we examine heart attack prediction factors including: 


## Data Collecting (ETL)

## PCA
* Since we are looking at many different factors to predict an outcome, it will be helpful to reduce the dimensions to provide simplicity. 
* We hope to reduce our data to only two dimensions 
* There is a lot of variance within our variables, we want to simplify and create bigger, more meaningful features
* Using PCA we find three clusters, which we can then use to categorize individuals based on certain traits
* We find there are three clusters, which here means groups that have certain characteristics
